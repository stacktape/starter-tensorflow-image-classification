# GPU Batch Job (TensorFlow)

> [!TIP]
> To deploy this project using **GUI-based flow**, navigate to [console](https://console.stacktape.com/create-new-project/git-project-using-console?name=my-stacktape-app&repositoryType=public&repositoryUrl=https://github.com/stacktape/starter-tensorflow-image-classification)

- GPU-capable [batch job](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/batch-jobs/) for image classification using
  TensorFlow.
- Upload a `.zip` of images to the input S3 bucket — the job automatically classifies them using a pre-trained
  EfficientNet model and saves results to the output bucket.
- Uses [spot instances](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/batch-jobs/#spot-instances) for up to 90% cost
  savings. Perfect as a starting point for any ML batch processing workload.
- This project includes a pre-configured [stacktape.yml configuration](stacktape.yml).
The configured infrastructure is described in the [stack description section](#stack-description)

## 1. Generate your project
To initialize the project, use

```bash
stacktape init --starterId tensorflow-image-classification
```

## 2. Before deploy
 - Install your projects dependencies. The recommended way is to use [Virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

## 3. Deploy your stack

The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

<details>
<summary>Deploy from local machine</summary>

<br />

The deployment from local machine will build and deploy the application from your system. This means you also need to have:
- Docker. To install Docker on your system, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).- [Python version > 3.9](https://www.python.org/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) package manager installed.

<br />

To perform the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --projectName <<project-name>> --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

`projectName` is the name of your project. You can create it in the console or interactively using CLI.

<br />

| Region name & Location     | code           |
  | -------------------------- | -------------- |
  | Europe (Ireland)           | eu-west-1      |

<summary>Deploy using AWS CodeBuild pipeline</summary>

<br />

Deployment using AWS CodeBuild will build and deploy your application inside [AWS CodeBuild pipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/). To perform the deployment, use

stacktape codebuild:deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>> --projectName <<project-name>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

`projectName` is the name of your project. You can create it in the console or interactively using CLI.

## 4. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the terminal (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

- Upload a `.zip` file containing images to the **input bucket** (bucket name is printed after deploy). You can use the
  included `pictures/test-pictures.zip` or your own images.
  ```bash
  aws s3 cp pictures/test-pictures.zip s3://<INPUT_BUCKET_NAME>/test-pictures.zip
  ```
- The batch job triggers automatically on upload. Classified images appear in the **output bucket**, organized into
  folders by predicted class.
- Monitor job progress in the [AWS Batch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/batch/) or CloudWatch Logs.





## 5. Hotswap deploys
- Stacktape deployments use [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.

- To speed up the deployment, you can use the `--hotSwap` flag which avoids using Cloudformation.
- Hotswap deployments work only for source code changes (for lambda function, containers and batch jobs) and for content uploads to buckets.
- If the update deployment is not hot-swappable, Stacktape will automatically fall back to using a Cloudformation deployment.
```bash
stacktape deploy --hotSwap --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>> --projectName <<project-name>>
```

## 6. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stacktape delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

  Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
  pipeline and other aspects of your project.

  You can deploy your project to multiple environments (stages) - for
  example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`. A stack is a running instance of an project. It consists of your application
  code (if any) and the infrastructure resources required to run it.

  The configuration for this project is described below.

  ## 1. Resources

  - Every resource must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
  - Stacktape resources consist of multiple underlying AWS or 3rd party resources.
### 1.1 Buckets

Two S3 buckets handle the data pipeline:

- **inputBucket** — upload `.zip` archives of images here to kick off classification.
- **outputBucket** — the batch job writes classified images here, organized into folders by predicted class.

Both use the default [bucket configuration](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/buckets/).

```yml
inputBucket:
  type: bucket

outputBucket:
  type: bucket
```

### 1.2 Batch job

The classifier runs as a GPU-capable batch job using
[spot instances](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/batch-jobs/#spot-instances) for up to 90 % cost savings.

- **S3 event trigger** — an `s3:ObjectCreated` event on the input bucket (filtered to `.zip` suffix) starts the job
  automatically. No polling, no cron — just upload and go.
- **Container packaging** — uses a custom `Dockerfile` based on the
  [TensorFlow image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/). Stacktape builds the image and pushes it to a
  managed ECR repository. You can also use
  [other packaging types](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/packaging/#packaging-multi-container-workloads).
- **connectTo** — listing `inputBucket` and `outputBucket` in `connectTo` makes Stacktape automatically create the
  required IAM permissions **and** inject environment variables (bucket names, ARNs) into the container. No manual
  policy writing needed.
- **Resources & spot** — `cpu` and `memory` define the instance size AWS provisions on demand. Setting
  `useSpotInstances: true` opts into spot capacity, cutting costs significantly for fault-tolerant ML workloads.
- **Swap the model** — while this starter uses TensorFlow + EfficientNet, you can replace it with any ML framework
  (PyTorch, JAX, etc.) by changing the Dockerfile and source code. The infrastructure stays the same.

```yml
classifierJob:
  type: batch-job
  properties:
    container:
      packaging:
        type: custom-dockerfile
        properties:
          buildContextPath: ./
    resources:
      cpu: 2
      memory: 14000
    useSpotInstances: true
    connectTo:
      - inputBucket
      - outputBucket
    events:
      - type: s3
        properties:
          bucketArn: $ResourceParam('inputBucket', 'arn')
          s3EventType: s3:ObjectCreated:*
          filterRule:
            suffix: .zip
```
